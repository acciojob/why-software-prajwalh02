	<h1>Why I want to become a developer?</h1>
	<p>I have always been fascinated by the world of technology and how software can be used to solve real-world problems. As a software developer, I see the opportunity to make a meaningful impact on people's lives by creating innovative solutions. The endless possibilities of what can be built through coding excite me, and the challenge of continuously learning and adapting in this fast-paced field is something I look forward to.
